#The Joyner Conjecture is a not-at-all famous mathematical
#series inspired by the Collatz Conjecture for use in this
#class.
#
#The Joyner Conjecture proceeds as follows:
#
#Start with any number. If the number is divisible by 3,
#divide it by 3. Otherwise, add 2 to the number. Eventually,
#no matter what number you begin with, this series will run
#into 1 or 2. If it runs into 1, it will repeat 1-3 forever.
#If it runs into 2, it will repeat 2-4-6 forever.
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 5:
#5 is not divisible by 3, so 5 + 2 = 7
#7 is not divisible by 3, so 7 + 2 = 9
#9 is divisible by 3, so 9 / 3 = 3
#3 is divisible by 3, so 3 / 3 = 1
#
#Start with 5, this sequence converges on 1 in 4 iterations:
#5 -> 7, 7 -> 9, 9 -> 3, 3 -> 1.
#
#Write a function called joyner. joyner should have one
#parameter, an integer. It should return the number of
#iterations required to reach either 1 or 2 for the first
#time.
