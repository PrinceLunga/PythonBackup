#Write a function called count_types. count_types
#should take as input a single string, and return a
#dictionary. In the dictionary, the keys should be
#types of characters, and the values should be the
#number of times each type of character appeared in
#the string.
#
#The types of characters that should be handled (and
#thus, the keys in the dictionary) are:
#
# - upper: the count of upper-case or capital letters
# - lower: the count of lower-case letters
# - punctuation: the count of punctuation characters.
#   You may assume this is limited to these punctuation
#   characters: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
# - space: the count of spaces
# - numeral: the count of numerals, 0123456789
#
#Note, however, that any type of character that does
#NOT appear in the string should not be in the dictionary
#at all.
#
#For example:
#
#count_characters("aabbccc") -> 
# {"lower": 7}
#count_characters("ABC 123 doe ray me!") -> 
# {"upper": 3, "lower": 8, "punctuation": 1, "space": 4, "numeral": 3}
#
#Because the first string has only lower-case letters,
#"lower" is the only key in the dictionary.
#
#HINT: If you're sing the ord() function, capitals of
#ordinals between 65 and 90; lower-case letters have
#ordinals between 97 and 122; numerals are between 48
#and 57; spaces are 32; all other numbers between 33
#and 126 are punctuations, and no character will have
#an ordinal outside that range.

#Imagine you're writing the code for an onboard vehicle

#lead to intermittent bad readings: if it takes a reading
#as a car goes over a bump, for example, it will be way
#higher than it would have been otherwise. So, the system
#needs to know to ignore these ratings, as well as only
#process the more recent measurements. Let's tell the system

#Fibonacci numbers to the end of the sequence. A pseudo-
#Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two numbers in

#
#For example, if the original list given was:

#The game Mancala is one of the oldest games in recorded
#history. You can read more about it here:
#https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-play-mancala-409424
#
#For this problem, though, you don't need to know how to
#play the game. All you need to know is the board layout
#and the conditions for winning.
#
#A Mancala board is made of two rows of 6 cups, with two
#bigger cups at the ends. Each cup holds some number of
#stones or chips. For our purposes, though, we'll include
#the bigger cups at the end of the corresponding rows.
#
#So, for us, a Mancala board is represented as a
#2-dimensional list of integers. Each item in the lists
#represents a cup, and the number represents how many
#stones are currently in that cup. For example, this
#could be one board:
#
# [[5, 3, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1],
#  [1, 6, 8, 0, 4, 1, 4]]
#
#With this board representation, the game is over when
#every cup is empty except the top left and the bottom
#right. When the game is over, whoever has more stones
#in their cup wins: if the top left has more stones, the
#top player wins. If the bottom right has more stones,
#the bottom player wins.
#
#Write a function called check_winner. check_winner takes
#as a 2-dimensional list representing a game board. You
#may assume list will always have two lists, each with
#7 items, corresponding to the board structure shown
#above.
#
#Your function should return one of four strings
#depending on the values of the list:
#
# - If the game is not over (that is, there are stones
#   in any bucket except for the top-left or bottom-
#   right), return "Keep playing!"
# - If the game is over and the top player wins (that is,
#   there are more stones in top-left than bottom-right),
#   return "Player 1 wins!"
# - If the game is over and the bottom player wins (that
#   is, there are more stones in the bottom-right than
#   the top-left), return "Player 2 wins!"
# - If the game is over but the score is tied (that is,
#   there is an equal number of stones in the top-left
#   and bottom-right), return "Draw!"


#Write your function here!



#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
